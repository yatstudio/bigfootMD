## Context

ADR 0091 added Gemini CLI to explicit external MCP setup, but Gemini was still absent from Bigfoot's selectable app-managed AI agents. That left the AI panel able to generate Gemini-compatible MCP configuration while the actual agent picker, availability checks, install links, and streaming dispatch did not treat Gemini like Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, or Pi.

Gemini CLI supports headless `--prompt` execution with JSON output, configurable approval modes, tool exclusion, and settings-file overrides through `GEMINI_CLI_SYSTEM_SETTINGS_PATH`. Those features are enough to launch Gemini from Bigfoot without mutating the user's durable `~/.gemini/settings.json` during app-managed sessions.

## Decision

Bigfoot adds Gemini CLI as a first-class `AiAgentId`. The frontend agent definitions, onboarding prompt, install links, default-agent normalization, status badge, command registry, settings persistence, and mock Tauri status payloads include `gemini`.

The desktop backend adds a Gemini adapter that:

- discovers `gemini` through the process path, login shell, and common local/toolchain install locations
- runs `gemini --output-format json --approval-mode <mode> --prompt <prompt>` from the active vault
- supplies Bigfoot MCP through a temporary settings file referenced by `GEMINI_CLI_SYSTEM_SETTINGS_PATH`
- uses Safe mode with `auto_edit`, an untrusted MCP entry, and `tools.exclude=["run_shell_command"]`
- uses Power User mode with `yolo` and a trusted Bigfoot MCP entry
- maps Gemini JSON responses into Bigfoot's existing AI panel stream events

The existing external MCP setup remains explicit and durable. The app-managed Gemini adapter uses transient settings so selecting Gemini in Bigfoot does not rewrite the user's global Gemini config.

## Options Considered

- **Add Gemini as a first-class app-managed agent** (chosen): matches the existing agent picker and onboarding UI, uses Gemini's headless JSON mode, and keeps MCP setup vault-scoped.
- **Keep Gemini as external MCP setup only**: avoids another adapter, but keeps the interface inconsistent and requires users to leave Bigfoot for a flow that other agents support in-panel.
- **Write app-managed Gemini config into `~/.gemini/settings.json`**: reuses the external setup path, but would blur the consent boundary and risk overwriting user preferences during normal AI panel usage.
- **Use interactive Gemini sessions**: could preserve richer CLI state, but does not fit Bigfoot's current one-request stream lifecycle and would make cleanup/auth/error handling harder.

## Consequences

- Gemini appears anywhere users can choose, install, or switch local AI agents.
- End-to-end native Gemini QA requires the Gemini CLI to be installed and authenticated, but missing/auth failures now produce agent-specific guidance.
- Safe and Power User behavior is limited by Gemini's own approval/tool semantics; if Gemini changes those names, the adapter tests and docs need updating.
- The durable MCP setup path and optional `GEMINI.md` shim continue to serve external Gemini usage outside Bigfoot's AI panel.

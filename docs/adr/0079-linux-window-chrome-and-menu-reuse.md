## Context

Bigfoot Note's desktop shell was designed around macOS window chrome. `titleBarStyle: "Overlay"` and `hiddenTitle: true` give the app a clean single-surface titlebar on macOS, but Linux ignores those flags and draws native GTK decorations and a native menu bar on top of the React UI. That creates a double-titlebar effect, mismatched theming, and inconsistent behavior between the main window and detached note windows.

We still need Linux to reuse Bigfoot Note's existing command palette, shortcut manifest, and deterministic menu-command routing instead of inventing a Linux-only command path.

## Decision

**Bigfoot Note uses custom React-rendered window chrome on Linux and routes its menu through the existing shared command IDs.**

- The main Tauri window disables server-side decorations on Linux during app setup.
- Detached note windows set `decorations: false` when Linux chrome is active.
- `LinuxTitlebar` renders the drag region, resize handles, and window controls for Linux windows.
- `LinuxMenuButton` mirrors the app's File/Edit/View/Go/Note/Vault/Window menus, but dispatches the existing command IDs through `trigger_menu_command`.
- The native Tauri menu bar is not mounted on Linux; macOS and other existing desktop targets keep the native menu.
- Shared shortcuts remain defined in `appCommandCatalog.ts`, including `Cmd+Shift+L` on macOS and `Ctrl+Shift+L` on Linux through the same command manifest.

## Options considered

- **React-rendered Linux chrome with shared command IDs** (chosen): keeps Linux visually aligned with Bigfoot Note's existing shell and preserves one command-routing model across keyboard shortcuts, menu clicks, and QA helpers. Cons: Bigfoot Note now owns Linux window chrome behavior directly.
- **Keep native GTK decorations and menu bar on Linux**: cheaper to ship, but it breaks visual consistency and produces overlapping titlebar/menu surfaces that do not match the rest of the app.
- **Introduce Linux-only command wiring for the custom menu**: would allow a Linux-specific implementation, but it would fork the shortcut/menu architecture and weaken deterministic QA.

## Consequences

- Linux main windows and detached note windows now present one consistent titlebar surface controlled by Bigfoot Note.
- Menu commands, command palette actions, and deterministic QA still share the same command IDs, which limits platform-specific drift.
- Linux packaging and CI must install WebKit2GTK 4.1 dependencies and produce Linux bundles explicitly.
- Bigfoot Note now owns Linux resize handles, maximize/minimize/close behavior, and titlebar drag-region behavior in the renderer, so regressions in those surfaces require direct tests.

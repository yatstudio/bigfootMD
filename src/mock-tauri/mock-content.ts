## Wiki-Links
See [[Stock Screener — EMA200 Wick Bounce]] for the experiment approach.
Contact [[Matteo Cellini]] for sponsorship data.
Link to [[Grow Newsletter]] responsibility.
Check [[Software Development]] for tech notes.
See [[Bigfoot App Design Session]] event recap.
Read [[Write Weekly Essays]] procedure.
Also see [[Non-Existent Note]] which is a broken link.

## Paragraphs & Spacing
This is a normal paragraph with enough text to test line wrapping and spacing between elements. The paragraph should have comfortable line height and spacing from the heading above.

And this is a second paragraph to verify inter-paragraph spacing is correct. Good typography requires consistent vertical rhythm throughout the document.

# Stock Screener — EMA200 Wick Bounce

## Hypothesis
Stocks that wick below the 200-day EMA and close above it show a **statistically significant bounce** in the following 5-10 days.

## Setup
- Scan for daily candles where:
  - Low < EMA200
  - Close > EMA200
  - Volume > 1.5x average
- Filter for mid-cap stocks ($2B-$20B)

## Results So Far
| Date | Ticker | Entry | Exit | Return |
|------|--------|-------|------|--------|
| 2026-01-15 | AAPL | 182.30 | 189.50 | +3.9% |
| 2026-01-22 | MSFT | 410.20 | 418.80 | +2.1% |

## Next Steps
- [ ] Backtest on 10 years of data
- [ ] Add RSI filter for oversold confirmation
- [ ] Build automated alerts via Python script

# Facebook Ads Strategy

## Key Learnings
- **Lookalike audiences** from newsletter subscribers convert 3x better than interest-based targeting
- Video ads outperform static images by 40% on engagement
- Best performing CTA: "Join 50,000 engineers" (social proof)

## Budget
- Monthly budget: $2,000
- Cost per subscriber: ~$1.50 (down from $3.20 in Q3 2025)

## A/B Tests Running
1. Long-form vs short-form ad copy
2. Testimonial vs data-driven creative

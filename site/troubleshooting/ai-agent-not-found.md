# AI Agent Not Found

Bigfoot Note can only launch local CLI agents that are installed and discoverable.

## Symptoms

- The AI panel says no supported agent is available.
- Claude Code or another agent works in one shell but not in Bigfoot Note.

## Checks

Open a terminal and run the agent command directly. For Claude Code:

```bash
claude --version
```

If the command fails, install or repair the agent first.

## Path Issues

Desktop apps can inherit a different `PATH` from your interactive shell. Bigfoot Note checks common install locations, but shell setup can still vary. Prefer installing CLI tools in standard locations or making them available from your login shell.

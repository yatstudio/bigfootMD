# Vaults

A vault is the folder Bigfoot Note reads and writes. The filesystem is the source of truth; the app state and cache are derived from files.

## Core Rules

- Notes are Markdown files.
- YAML frontmatter provides structure.
- Attachments are normal files inside the vault.
- Type definitions and saved views are also files.
- Git can track history and support remote sync.

## Why Local Files Matter

Local files keep your notes inspectable. You can open them in another editor, search with command-line tools, back them up with your own system, and version them with Git.

Bigfoot Note should never become the only way to read your data.

## Git Is A Capability

A plain folder of Markdown files can open as a vault. Git-backed vaults unlock history, changes, commits, pull, push, conflict handling, and remote setup.

If a folder is not a Git repository, Bigfoot Note can initialize Git when you explicitly ask it to. It avoids initializing broad personal folders such as Desktop, Documents, or Downloads unless they are clearly dedicated vault folders.

## Multiple Vaults At The Same Time

Bigfoot Note can load multiple registered vaults into one unified graph. Enable this from `Settings` -> `Vaults` -> `Use multiple vaults at the same time`.

After the option is enabled, open the bottom-left vault menu to include or exclude vaults from the graph. Included vaults appear together in note lists, search, quick open, backlinks, and wikilink navigation. Each note keeps a compact vault badge when Bigfoot Note needs to disambiguate where it lives.

The selected vault still matters. Git status, commits, sync, folder navigation, saved views, and vault repair actions stay scoped to the current repository. Use `Manage vaults` from the vault menu or the Vaults settings section to rename vaults, choose colors, and set the default destination for new notes.

Cross-vault wikilinks use the target vault's stable alias when needed, for example `[[team/projects/alpha]]`. Links inside the same vault stay normal vault-relative links.

## App State Versus Vault State

Vault-level information should travel with the vault. Machine-specific preferences stay with the app installation.

| Vault state | App state |
| --- | --- |
| Type icons and colors | Editor zoom |
| Saved views | Window size |
| Pinned properties | Recent vault list |
| Relationship conventions | Local cache |
| Vault AI guidance files | AI target selection |
